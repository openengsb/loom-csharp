    <para>To install the .Net Bridge you have to download the source code and using maven to build
      the project. This will creates the all the dlls, which can be included to every
      project.</para>
    <para>The .Net Bridge has some dependencies which are generated as well and included in the zip
      file in the folder assembly/target. </para>
    <para>If you use NPanday in your project, instead of adding the file from the .Net Bridge zip
      (assembly/target), you can add the dependencies over NPanday visual studio plugin.  Please use
        <emphasis role="italic">mvn clean install</emphasis> before.</para>
    <ns:para>After building the .Net Bridge and opening the source code with visual studio some references canâ€™t be found. When using the NPanday visual studio plugin the references can be added again via the plugin. This is done by resynchronizing the references which is shown in the following picture.</ns:para>
